				<p>For 100 years, Sacred Heart Health System’s mission of high-quality compassionate healthcare has impacted generations of families in Northwest Florida. Sacred Heart Foundation donors, much like The Sisters of Charity, put their care and concern for those in need into action — supporting the tiniest newborns to the most elderly seniors, and making the difference for every patient who walks through our doors.</p>

				<p>As a not-for-profit organization, we rely on generous, compassionate people like you to support our work ensuring that no one goes without quality patient care, and life-saving treatment. Make your tax-deductible gift today, and join a century-old legacy of caring from the heart.</p>

				<p>If you would like to make a donation by phone or if you have any questions, please call toll free 1-800-SacredGift.</p>
